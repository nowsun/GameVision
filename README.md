## Overview
GameVision Toolkit (GVT) Is advanced 2D [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) based game library for PC's running Microsoft Windows® and uses Direct3D® for hardware accelerated rendering.

It's robust, designed for easy use and suitable for making all types of 2D games and other graphic simulations, You access the features from a simple and intuitive procedural API, to allow you to rapidly and efficiently develop your graphics simulations. There is support for buffers, bitmaps, audio samples, streaming music, video playback, loading resources directly from a standard zip archive, and much more.

## History
It began life back in the mid 1990's as a high speed rendering library and over the years evolved into a game application framework with many nice features that allow you to make a complete game project. I enjoy the space shooter genre, so all of my games have been been of this type. 

Some of the games that I created with it include:
* Astro3D
* Star Blazer
* Outpost 9
* Quest
* Planetstrike 
* Stellar Defense
* Xarlor
* FreeStrike

The new 2.x releases on GitHub is the evolution of the product bringing new features and support for modern hardware. The first project I plan to do with the updated version will be FreeStrike 2.
